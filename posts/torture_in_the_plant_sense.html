                    Last week I've submitted my PhD thesis for review, after two months of deep
                    work on it. But despite the deadline getting closer and closer, I have made a
                    concentrated effort not to overwork myself. I have not pulled all nighters, not
                    even once. The sense of urgency was there, but I kept myself at bay. I chose to
                    stay calm and not overstress. At the end of each day I chose to believe in my
                    future, well rested self to inch myself ever closer to the end.While it may
                    sound like it, believe me it was not easy. I acted trying to learn from my past
                    experience, where I saw that blindly striving to solve all tasks as soon as
                    possible draws out all my energies and I burnout. I have had bi-weekly burnouts
                    for an entire year I think. With this strategy, over two months spent writing
                    the thesis, I burned out only one day.
            </p>

            <p>
                    Lately, my number one priority is not to burnout. I now understand that I need
                    to get to know myself, what are my limits and where it is sustainable to
                    challenge them. Challenging my limits too much is counterproductive, as it
                    has led many times to burnout, where the body just steps on the brake pedal,
                    because I have gone too far. Not realizing that too much work is being done is
                    dangerous. I think our subconscious understands that its self destructive.
            </p>

            <p>
                    I have a friend that cultivates avocado trees in his house. His avocados look
                    pretty nice, he has many around his place, including a big one on his terrace.
                    He explained to me that in order to get better plants he need to "torture" them
                    (at least, that is the verb he uses in French, "tourturer", I should see if
                    that translates to "torture" in English within this context). Sometimes he cuts
                    a branch or bends the plant in a weird, uncomfortable way, and the response of
                    the plant leads to a better growth.
                    As much as it sound cliché, I think we do the same to ourselves to grow. We
                    torture ourself, to a controlled extent, in order to grow.
            </p>

            <p>
                    Torturing (in the plant sense, I'll come back to this later) requires
                    the highest degree of self control. One
                    needs to understand exactly how much torture to impart. Torture
                    too little, which means be lazy, and there won't be as much growth as it could.
                    This will lead to regret, and unhappiness. Torture too much, energy will start
                    withering away. This will lead to exhaustion, thus damaging 
                    productivity, leading to unhappiness all the same. The balance has to be perfect
                    to be on a path of sustainable growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                    This means that we should always be managing the amount of self torture we
                    impart on ourselves. We should be asking: am I torturing myself too much? Too
                    little? Am I getting the balance right? Moreover, any excess in both directions
                    should be corrected quickly. This is because things get out of hand without us
                    realizing. One day you might realize that you've been slacking for a month, and
                    now you have scramble to recover. On the other hand, one day you just can't
                    bring yourself to work, and oh what is that? Am I having a mental breakdown?
                    Welp, looks like it. Torture has a butterfly effect on
                    our lives, and we do not reflect on this as much as we should. I know I don't.
            <p>
            <p>
                    I didn't mean to use the word torture so much, but this is how this flux of
                    conscience turned out. I'd like to clarify that the metaphore works as intended
                    only if the word "torture" is read in this plant-husbandry sense that I
                    encountered in a French conversation. I find its use thought provoking, the word
                    stands out so much, but in the end its meaning is less gruesome than what we
                    normally use it for. That is to say, I do not think that work should be torture
                    in the human sense, I think work should be torture in the plant sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                    So, torture yourself in the plant sense.
