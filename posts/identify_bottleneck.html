                    Acting before thinking subtly slows 
                    down work instead of accelearting it. It should be reasoned out.

                    Say you have to write a PhD thesis in very little time. You have agreed on an
                    outline with your supervisor(-s in my case), and now you have to pump out
                    section after section, chapter after chapter. 
                    You see the deadline coming in, you feel you must write as much as possible,
                    so you just start.
                    It turns out that this is a pitfall, you will end up wasting precious time.
                    This is because, in the rush of writing, you will start making mistakes and 
                    will need to backtrack. 
                    Also, as you push yourself to write more and more, you realize that there are 
                    many blind spots in your knowledge, and have to stop to do some research.
                    You write, but end up in many cul-de-sacs that force you to do multiple passes,
                    and delays accumulate.
                    The good practice, instead, would be to slow down on the writing, and spend 
                    more time first into clarifying what each section should contain. 
                    When this is sorted out, then you write, and move on. This is a sustainable
                    work process that can get you somewhere (hopefully).

                    The story above represents, of course, my own experience in this very moment
                    of my life. The second part of the paragraph is the workflow I am trying to
                    implement right now, to "do things righ".
                    Maybe this situation is too subjective, but I think this can be generalized to
                    work in general. 
                    Imagine for example a software developer needing to push out important 
                    updates. 
                    You would think that he should be consuming his hands on the keyboard at all
                    times of the day, to code as much as possible.
                    But in reality, what he should be doing is studying the problem, obtain a 
                    deep understanding of the issue, construct a mental model of the solution.
                    Only then, the solution should be implemented. I cannot think of a work that 
                    does not benefit from thinking as much as possible before executing.

                    <i>Not</i> doing this is what I would call blind execution. We are told to fill
                    our <i>agendae</i> with things to do, while we should fill them with things to think.
                    The execution should follow some solution we have figured out about the problem
                    at hand.
                    It takes a certain courage to follow through with this work flow.
                    It is unintuitive because uou <i>feel</i> that you <i>should</i> do the task at hand. 
                    Instead, the best outcome comes from putting execution after clarity and 
                    respecting this rationale religiously. No clarity, no execution. It is a work
                    principle, a fundamental of work process.

                    This blog is titled like this because blind execution represents a bottleneck.
                    Acting before thinking is a losing strategy: problems will be encountered 
                    systematically, requiring to go back to the blackboard and start from scratch
                    again. This bottleneck is removed by back-loading the work with a good 
                    dose of thinking. To summarize with one of many quips my supervisor told 
                    me throughout my PhD: "less doing, more thinking." I did not get what he this
                    meant then, while I think I get it now.
